## Requests

To request a new source or bug fix, [create an issue](https://github.com/petalya/yomiko-extensions-source/issues/new/choose).

Please note that creating an issue does not mean that the source will be added or fixed in a timely fashion, because the work is volunteer-based. Some sources may also be impossible to do or prohibitively difficult to maintain.

If you would like to see a request fulfilled and have the necessary skills to do so, consider contributing! Issues are up-for-grabs for any developer if there is no assigned user already.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome!

Check out the repo's [issue backlog](https://github.com/petalya/yomiko-extensions-source/issues) for source requests and bug reports.
